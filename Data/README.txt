DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: 4_XylonichusCylinderDiameters.csv

1. Number of variables: 13

2. Number of cases/rows: 738

3. Variable List: 

section: This refers to the TEM section form which the rectangle sample was extracted. We considered 3 TEM sections for this analysis
rectangle: A code asigned to each rectangle of dimensions 5 x 5 um extracted from the TEM section. In total we analyzed 5 rectangles for each TEM sections 
ROI: This is a number asigned to each particle within one rectangle (also refered as Region of interest ROI)
label: Consolidated of the TEM section and the rectangle. 
xcentroid: Position of the particle (ROI) in the x axis of the image
ycentroid: Position of the particle (ROI) in the y axis of the image
MajorAxis: Major axis of the elypse fitted to the ROI
MinorAxis: Minor axis of the elypse fitted to the ROI
angle: (0-180 degrees) is the angle between the primary axis and a line parallel to the x-axis of the image
circ.: circularity of the elypse fitted to the ROI. 4π*area/perimeter^2. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect circle. As the value approaches 0.0, it indicates an increasingly elongated shape. 
AR: (aspect ratio): major_axis/minor_axis. 
round: (roundness): 4*area/(π*major_axis^2), or the inverse of the aspect ratio.
solidity: area/convex area.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: 5_XylonichusCentroidDistance.csv

1. Number of variables: 

2. Number of cases/rows: 

3. Variable List: 

label: Consolidated of the TEM section and the rectangle. 
ROI: This is a number asigned to each particle within one rectangle (also refered as Region of interest ROI)
x: Position of the particle (ROI) in the x axis of the image
y: Position of the particle (ROI) in the y axis of the image
ROIcomp: This is the number of a particle adjacent to the ROI. The centroids of ROI and ROIcomp will be compared to find the centre to centre distance by calculating the euclidean distance
x1: Position of the particle (ROIcomp) in the x axis of the image
y2: Position of the particle (ROIcomp) in the y axis of the image
